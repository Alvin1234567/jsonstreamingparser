php-streaming-json-parser
=========================

This is a simple, streaming parser for processing large JSON documents. Use it for parsing very large JSON documents to avoid loading the entire thing into memory, which is how just about every other JSON parser for PHP works.

If you've ever used a [SAX parser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML) for XML (or even JSON) in another language, that's what this is. Except for JSON in PHP.
